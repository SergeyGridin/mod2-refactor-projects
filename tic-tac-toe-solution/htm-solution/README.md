# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

**Starter project**:
https://github.com/appacademy-starters/dom-api-tic-tac-toe.git.

If you update this repository, make sure your changes are synchronized with the
starter project, if necessary.

The starter project contains the skeleton HTML, CSS, and JS file with the
proper `<script>` and `<link>` tags to tie them together.
